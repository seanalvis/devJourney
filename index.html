				<h2>It's alive!!!</h2>
				<p>Yes that deserves three exclamation points! So I am typing this directly into the code and then uploading it straight to FTP. This is cowboy as shit! So the site is live and I apologize for grammatical and spelling mistakes. I am literally coding this directly into <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. And make no doubt about it, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is by far my favorite text editor. So right now this site is rolling with no framework, no nothing. I don't even have a CSS page. I started from the ground up, but it is responsive! You don't need CSS for a fully responsive site, and this site is as accessible as you could possibly get! Well, maybe the text could be bigger.</p>
